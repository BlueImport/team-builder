// - Pass `memberToEdit` down to `Form.js`
// - If `Form` receives `props.memberToEdit`, then that member object should populate your state object that is controlling your forms. Now, it may be tempting to do something like this: `const [member, setMember] = useState(props.memberToEdit || {name: '', email: '', role: ''})` for our form to update with whatever member we click on. However, this is a trap that will cause a pretty big bug in our app. If props are used to set state like this, the state property will _NOT_ update when the prop changes. So... what kind of technique have we learned to keep something in sync with props when they change? `useEffect`! Write an effect that syncs with `props.memberToEdit`. When `props.memberToEdit` changes, the effect will update the `member` state object with the new data. This will populate the inputs with whichever member we are trying to update.

// The flow for editing is hard to conceptualize. It should go something like this:

// 1. Our user clicks the `Edit` button/icon to start editing a team member
// 1. A function in App is invoked that sets the clicked member to `memberToEdit` on state
// 1. `Form.js` is receiving `memberToEdit` as a prop, and if that prop changes, the effect we built will set that object to state and populate the form with that member's info
// 1. The user updates the member info
// 1. Uh... now what do we do with this new data? If we submit the form, it will just add a new member ðŸ˜«. Never fear! We will fix this in the next section!
